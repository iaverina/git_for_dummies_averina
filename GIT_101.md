# GIT for dummies from Averina Irina

## Basic rules for formatting content in markdown:

1. __Lists__

    1.1. Unnumbered list can be created by adding a "*" sign at the beginning of the line with space between the sign and the text

    * example of a text #1
    * example of a text #2
    * example of a text N

     1.2. Numbered lists are created by adding a number followed by a dot at the biginnig of each point of the list with space between the dot and following text. This table of contents is a numbered list.

2. __Text formatting__

    2.1. Making text *italic*: text surrounded by two *'s or two _'s without spaces will be formatted as *italic with asterisks* / _italic with underliners_.

    2.2. Making text **bold**: text surrounded by two couples of *'s or _'s without spaces will be formatted as **bold with two asterisks** / __bold with two underliners__.

  3. __Tables__

Please, see the printscreen of the editor view to compare it with the preview below:

To create the table below I used Markdown Tables Extension:

|  The extension    |   helps  |  you  |   create  |   tables  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  like   |  -   |  this   |   -  |   one  |

or you can do it manually if that is a small table like the one below:

| Action you need to do in the editor | The outcome that will show in the preview
|:-----------------------------------:| :----------------------------------------:
| This is how it is formatted in the editor | And this is how it looks in the preview |  Id wetrfkgwkjhwre | 
| So you need to use symbols shown in the editor | To create format shown in this preview
|If you need to leave come cells empty | Just keep the formatting as shown below

4. __Hyperlinks__

Markdown syntax for a hyperlink is square brackets followed by parentheses. The square brackets hold the text, the parentheses hold the link. Like it is shown in Basic Syntax @ [MarkDownGuide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

5. __Pictures__: to insert a picture first save the picture into the folder with your repository and then click and drag holding shift to insert the picture into the editor.

6. __Quotes__: To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
